# Campus-events-registration---web-project-
To design and create a centralized platform to provide students access to all the events happening on campus and book advanced tickets for those events. There are lots of events going on in the campus. To keep track of these events is a big workload. Our event system keeps track of these events. Moreover, many events have limited seats and our ticket reservation will help the student to pick a spot for the event. Many a times, if it’s a new student, they have very limited resources and are particularly clueless about what’s happening in the college. These events may be sporting or educational. This system also helps the staff and students to reduce the hassle during the event while buying tickets. The student can view all events happening like sports, educational lectures, movies, fun activities near library among others. They can see its timings and book seats according to their liking. We are helping to bridge the gap between the college events and students. The application provides a good opportunity to students to keep track of the events happing on campus and RSVP for them. It also provides opportunity to all the event managers to reach out to the students.
